= 2.0.1 (WIP)
* Ruby 1.9 compatibility

= 2.0.0

* use a set of standard exceptions based on MogileFS::Error,
  this is an incompatible API change (hence the 2.0.0 version number).
* remove NFS support since it's gone in MogileFS 2.x and NFS is horrible
* mog timeouts and retries increased
* more consistent handling of bad sockets, all sockets used internally
  are now explicitly non-blocking and IO.select is used for timeouts
  instead of using threads behind our backs
* remove open-uri and net/http dependencies, they were bad with large files
* add paths_size() method, allowing single mogilefsd call to get size and paths
* add read-only MogileFS::Mysql driver, allowing mogilefsd to be bypassed
* use TCP_NODELAY when available on sockets that require low latency
* use TCP_CORK on bulk transfers to improve bandwidth usage
* better HTTP error handling
* verify_uris method in new MogileFS::Network module which allows
  async verification of several URIs at once on the client side.
* handle multiple device failover correctly on HTTP uploads
* initial big_file read support (should be mogtool(1)-compatible)
* unit tests can be run in parallel using GNU Make, 3x faster on a Core2 Duo
* unit tests modified to use real sockets for easier verification of
  timeout and error condition handling.
